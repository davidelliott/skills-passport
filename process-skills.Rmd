## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

Thanks for filling in the skills passport form. Here is a report on your responses and the skills we have recorded for you. Please note that the recorded skills can be highly variable depending on your module selections, and we are gradually increasing the skills recording in the programme. You can optionally use this report to assist in your skills related assessments. We hope that as you continue to build up your skills passport that it will provide a valuable resource for reflecting upon your personal development and building your CV etc.\n\n
