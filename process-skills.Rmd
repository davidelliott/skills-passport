This report lists the competencies we have recorded for each student in the selected cohort: `r class_name` (`r length(students)` students)

```{r import_data,echo=FALSE}
setwd("d:/git/skills-passport")


# load the competency list. This will need to be updated from the competencies spreadsheet if any skills are added
competencies <- read.csv(paste(getwd(),"/data/competencies.csv",sep=""))

# store the competency code in the "Competency" column (replaces the barcode which is of no use here)
competencies$Competency <- competencies$Code

# Format of the competencies file: (as CSV)
## Code	Competency	Competency description	Competency classification	skill group	type
## PSH01	*PSH01*	Use an automatic pipette for volumes between 100ul – 1000 ul	essential	Pipetting and sample handling	technical
## PSH02	*PSH02*	Use an automatic pipette for volumes between 1ul – 10 ul	desirable	Pipetting and sample handling	technical
## PSH03	*PSH03*	Use a serological pipette for volumes between 5 ml – 25 ml	desirable	Pipetting and sample handling	technical

# The competencies are followed by module and programme specific information, 
# but I plan to move this out into a different file to make system more flexible
# Then, the programme / module can be specified at run time to make customised reports

# Load ID mapping - this is needed because student badge numbers or other identifiers might not be the same as student ID
ID_mapping <- read.csv("data/ID_mapping/ID_mapping.csv")

# Filter by the selected class, if one is defined
if(length(students)>0) {

}

# subset to records of interest for a report
# ID_mapping <- ID_mapping[88:nrow(ID_mapping),]

# There are no headers in the file - see below for the column contents

# discard extra columns
scanner_reads <- scanner_reads[,1:7]

# The required format is that the ID column and observed competency match up with the format of "matched records"
# which is created later on. Note that the ID column from attendance records will typically be the student ID 
# which is different from the barcode, plus we do not have scans of the skills barcodes so we import manual records differently.
