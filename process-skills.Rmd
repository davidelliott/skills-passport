## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
setwd("d:/git/skills-passport")
getwd()
# load the competency list. This will need to be updated from the competencies spreadsheet if any skills are added
competencies <- read.csv(paste(getwd(),"/data/competencies.csv",sep=""))

# store the competency code in the "Competency" column (replaces the barcode which is of no use here)
competencies$Competency <- competencies$Code

# Format of the competencies file: (as CSV)
## Code	Competency	Competency description	Competency classification	skill group	type
## PSH01	*PSH01*	Use an automatic pipette for volumes between 100ul – 1000 ul	essential	Pipetting and sample handling	technical
## PSH02	*PSH02*	Use an automatic pipette for volumes between 1ul – 10 ul	desirable	Pipetting and sample handling	technical
## PSH03	*PSH03*	Use a serological pipette for volumes between 5 ml – 25 ml	desirable	Pipetting and sample handling	technical

# The competencies are followed by module and programme specific information, 
# but I plan to move this out into a different file to make system more flexible
# Then, the programme / module can be specified at run time to make customised reports

# Load ID mapping - this is needed because student badge numbers or other identifiers might not be the same as student ID
ID_mapping <- read.csv("data/ID_mapping/ID_mapping.csv")

# subset to records of interest for a report
# ID_mapping <- ID_mapping[88:nrow(ID_mapping),]
```


```{r}

# There are no headers in the file - see below for the column contents

# So in this example, the student P201544022 has been observed doing the competency PSH09

Thanks for filling in the skills passport form. Here is a report on your responses and the skills we have recorded for you. Please note that the recorded skills can be highly variable depending on your module selections, and we are gradually increasing the skills recording in the programme. You can optionally use this report to assist in your skills related assessments. We hope that as you continue to build up your skills passport that it will provide a valuable resource for reflecting upon your personal development and building your CV etc.\n\n
